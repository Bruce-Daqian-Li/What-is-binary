**Binary** (or base-2) a numeric system that only uses two digits â€” 0 and 1. Computers operate in binary, meaning they store data and perform calculations using only zeros and ones. A single binary digit can only represent True (1) or False (0) in boolean logic. However, multiple binary digits can be used to represent large numbers and perform complex functions. In fact, any integer can be represented in binary. Below is a list of several decimal (or "base-10") numbers represented in binary.
